# Network Functionality of Pryzm

Pryzm, crafted as a specialized Layer-1 blockchain, focuses on yield management and the tokenization of assets within the decentralized finance space. This document delves into these core functionalities.

## Core Functionalities

### Yield Tokenization
- **Description**: Splits yield-bearing assets into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT), allowing investors to manage yields separately from principal investments.
- **Implementation**: Employs smart contracts to automate the division and management of PTs and YTs, enabling dynamic and flexible investment strategies.

### Liquid Staking
- **Description**: Pryzm enhances liquidity in staking operations without sacrificing security or participation in governance.
- **Implementation**: Supports liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) that represent staked assets, allowing participation in other DeFi activities while earning staking rewards.

### Decentralized Trading
- **Description**: Facilitates the trading of PTs, YTs, and other cryptocurrencies through a decentralized exchange (DEX) built into the network.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes an advanced yield automated market maker (AMM) to ensure liquidity and fair pricing.

## Comparative Analysis
(Here, you can compare Pryzmâ€™s functionalities with other DeFi platforms, highlighting its unique approach to yield management and tokenization.)

## Use Cases
- **Yield Farming**: Utilizes PTs and YTs for innovative yield farming strategies.
- **Governance Participation**: Empowers token holders with the ability to participate in governance through liquid voting mechanisms.

## Technical Details
(Provide a more technical explanation of the functionalities, possibly with code snippets or diagrams illustrating the tokenization process.)

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Balancing liquidity and security in tokenized yield management.
- **Solution**: Implementing robust smart contracts and liquidity pools that maintain security while enhancing market efficiency.

## Conclusion
Pryzm sets itself apart in the DeFi landscape by focusing on yield optimization and innovative tokenization techniques, offering a unique platform for investors and developers alike.
