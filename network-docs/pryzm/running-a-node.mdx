# Running a Pryzm Node

Running a Pryzm node is crucial for participating in the Pryzm network. This guide covers various methods to set up and run a Pryzm node, including binary executions and Docker configurations.

## Running Pryzm with Binary

### Prerequisites
- **Pryzmd Binary**: Build or download the latest on-chain version of pryzmd.
- **Permissions**: Ensure executable permissions for your binary.

### Steps
1. **Execute Pryzmd Binary**: Run the command `./pryzmd [command] [flags]`. For starting the daemon, use `./pryzmd start`.
2. **Systemd Configuration**: Configure `pryzmd` to run as a systemd service for reliability.
   - Move the binary to `/usr/bin` with `cp pryzmd /usr/bin/`.
   - Create and edit the systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/pryzmd.service` with appropriate configurations.
3. **Manage Service**:
   - Reload systemd: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
   - Restart pryzmd: `sudo systemctl restart pryzmd`
   - Enable on boot: `sudo systemctl enable pryzmd`
   - Check logs: `journalctl -u pryzmd -fu`

### Configuring Pryzmd
- **Config Files**: Located in `$HOME/.pryzmd/config`.
  - `config.toml`: General settings.
  - `app.toml`: Application-specific settings.
  - `client.toml`: Pryzm client settings.

## Running Pryzmd with Docker

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
- **Pryzmd Image**: Obtain the Docker image from `europe-docker.pkg.dev/pryzm-zone/core/pryzmd:0.18.0`.

### Docker Commands
- **Run Pryzmd**: Execute Pryzmd using Docker by specifying configuration paths and ensuring data persistence. Example commands are provided for both testing and production environments.

### Docker Compose
- **Setup**: Use a `docker-compose.yml` file for running Pryzmd with Docker Compose.
- **Execution**: Start the service with `docker-compose up -d` and verify with `docker-compose ps`.

## Running Pryzm Feeder with Binary

### Prerequisites
- **Pryzm-Feeder Binary**: Build or download the pryzm-feeder binary.
- **TimescaleDB**: Ensure TimescaleDB is set up correctly.

### Execution
- **Run Feeder**: Use the command `$ node ./lib/vote.js [config file path]` to start the Pryzm feeder with the appropriate configuration.

### Configuration
- **Pryzm-Feeder Configuration**: Managed through a `config.yaml` file, details of which can be obtained from the documentation resources page.

## Running Pryzm Feeder with Docker

### Setup
- **Docker Images**: Ensure Docker images for both pryzm-feeder and TimescaleDB are available.
- **Configuration**: Proper configuration paths must be set to ensure effective running of the feeder service.

### Docker Compose
- **Configuration File**: Provide a `docker-compose.yml` file tailored to running the pryzm-feeder.
- **Management**: Use Docker Compose commands to manage the lifecycle of the pryzm-feeder service.

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines, you can effectively set up and manage Pryzm nodes and feeders using both binary and Docker methods, ensuring robust participation in the Pryzm network.
