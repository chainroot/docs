# Snapshot Recovery on Pryzm Network

Recovering your Pryzm node from a snapshot is an efficient way to restore your node without syncing from genesis, significantly reducing downtime. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use snapshots from `ss.chainroot.io` for recovery.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the recovery process, ensure that you have:

- A running Pryzm node that you can stop and restart.
- Sufficient disk space to accommodate the snapshot and future blocks.
- A stable internet connection for downloading the snapshot.

## Steps for Snapshot Recovery

### 1. Stop your Pryzm node

Ensure that no processes are running that might modify the data while you're performing the snapshot recovery.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop pryzmd
```

### 2. Download the Snapshot

Download the latest snapshot available from `ss.chainroot.io`. It's recommended to use `wget` or `curl` for downloading.

```bash
wget https://ss.chainroot.io/pryzm-latest.tar.gz
```

### 3. Extract the Snapshot

Once the download is complete, extract the snapshot file to the appropriate directory, typically where your Pryzm data is stored.

```bash
tar -xvzf pryzm-latest.tar.gz -C /path/to/pryzm/data
```

### 4. Restart your Pryzm node

After successfully extracting the snapshot, restart your node. It will start syncing from the point the snapshot was taken.

```bash
sudo systemctl start pryzmd
```

## Verifying Node Sync

After starting your node, it's important to verify that it is syncing correctly.

```bash
pryzmd status
```

This command should show that your node is catching up from the snapshot height to the current block height.

## Conclusion

Using snapshots for recovery can significantly reduce the time it takes to get your Pryzm node operational after downtime or when migrating to new hardware. Always ensure that snapshots are obtained from reliable sources and that you have backups of your own node to prevent data loss.

For more advanced recovery options or troubleshooting, consult the Pryzm documentation or reach out to the support community.
