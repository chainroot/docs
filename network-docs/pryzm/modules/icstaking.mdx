# ICStaking Module Overview

The **ICStaking** module in Pryzm enables liquid staking of native tokens from various Cosmos-based chains, allowing users to mint LSD tokens (cAsset) by staking their assets. This module provides a sophisticated mechanism to handle staked assets, automating the delegation and compounding of staking rewards.

## Key Features

- **Liquid Staking:** Users can stake their native tokens and receive cAssets, which represent their staked and earning assets.
- **Automated Compounding:** Automatically compounds staking rewards, enhancing the earning potential for stakers.
- **Interchain Functionality:** Utilizes Cosmos's interchain accounts feature for executing staking-related operations on supported chains.

## How It Works

### Staking Process

Users stake their native tokens by transferring them into the ICStaking module. The module batches these assets and delegates them to validators on the respective host chains at defined intervals. This process includes:

- **Batch Delegation:** Collects all incoming staking requests and processes them in batches to optimize transaction costs and efficiency.
- **Reward Compounding:** Automatically stakes the earned rewards to maximize the stakers' returns.

### Minting LSD Tokens

Upon staking, users receive LSD tokens, specifically cAssets, which represent their staked principal plus the accruing rewards. These tokens increase in value over time as the underlying staked assets earn rewards.

### Multi-Sig and Loopback Support

For chains not directly connected via ICA, the ICStaking module supports a multi-sig mechanism. This allows trusted multi-sig accounts to execute staking-related operations. Additionally, a loop-back feature enables staking of PRYZM's own bond token using the same infrastructure.

## Integration with Other Modules

The ICStaking module interacts with various other modules within the Pryzm ecosystem, providing a cohesive and integrated staking experience:

- **Oracle Module:** Utilizes real-time data for accurate reward distribution and compounding.
- **Governance Module:** Allows stakers to participate in governance decisions directly impacting the staking operations and parameters.

## User Guide

Users can interact with the ICStaking module using the following commands:

### Staking Tokens

```bash
pryzmd tx icstaking stake <amount> --from <your_wallet> --chain-id <host_chain_id>
```

### Unstaking Tokens

```bash
pryzmd tx icstaking unstake <amount> --from <your_wallet> --chain-id <host_chain_id>
```

### Checking Staking Balance

```bash
pryzmd query icstaking balance <wallet_address>
```

For more detailed instructions on how to use the ICStaking module, refer to the official documentation at [Pryzm ICStaking Documentation](https://docs.pryzm.zone/core/icstaking).

## Conclusion

The ICStaking module is a cornerstone of the Pryzm ecosystem, providing users with a flexible and powerful tool for earning rewards through staking. Its integration with Cosmos's interchain technology makes it a versatile solution for users looking to maximize their earnings while contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain networks they support.
