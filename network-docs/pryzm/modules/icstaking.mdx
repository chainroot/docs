# ICStaking Module

The ICStaking module is a core component of the Pryzm network that enables interchain liquid staking of Cosmos-based chainsâ€™ native tokens. This module supports the minting of cASSET as the liquid staking derivative (LSD), enhancing the flexibility and liquidity of staking operations within the network.

## Features

- **Interchain Liquid Staking**: Allows users to stake their native tokens of Cosmos-based chains and receive cASSET, a liquid representation of the staked assets.
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: cASSET can be used within the Pryzm DeFi ecosystem, providing liquidity while still earning staking rewards.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate smoothly with existing DeFi protocols within Pryzm, expanding the utility of staked assets.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Users can trade or use their staked assets in various financial products without unbonding, offering greater control over their investments.
- **Reward Optimization**: Facilitates earning staking rewards while participating in DeFi activities, maximizing return on investment.
- **Decentralized Security**: Enhances the security of the network by decentralizing the staking process across multiple chains.

## Use Cases

- **DeFi Participation**: Holders of cASSET can engage in lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities without relinquishing staking rewards.
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Investors can diversify their portfolio by acquiring cASSET from various Cosmos-based chains.

## Documentation Reference

For more detailed information and technical guidance on the ICStaking module, please refer to the [ICStaking documentation](https://docs.pryzm.zone/core/icstaking).

The ICStaking module represents a significant innovation in the staking landscape, merging traditional staking benefits with the dynamic capabilities of DeFi. It's a cornerstone of the Pryzm network's approach to integrating blockchain technology with real-world financial applications.
