## Overview

The **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** module in Pryzm enables decentralized trading by automatically matching buy and sell orders using predefined rules. It facilitates the creation and management of liquidity pools, enabling seamless token swaps and liquidity provisioning.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Trading**: Allows users to trade tokens directly within the Pryzm network through liquidity pools.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Users can create and manage liquidity pools, contributing to the network's trading volume and earning fees.
- **Token Swapping**: Supports swapping between different tokens, with prices determined by the pool's automated market-making rules.

## Configuration

The AMM module is highly configurable, enabling various pool types and token management strategies. Here's how you can set it up:

### Setting Up AMM
- Define your pool parameters, including the token types, weights, and initial balances.
- Choose the pool type (e.g., weighted AMM, yield AMM).
  
```bash
pryzmd tx amm create-pool <pool_params> --from <your_wallet> --chain-id <chain_id>
```

### Supported Pool Types

- **Weighted AMM Pools**: Balances tokens based on predefined weights, allowing more flexibility in liquidity management.
- **Yield AMM Pools**: Integrates yield generation mechanisms, automatically reinvesting returns into the pool.

## Operations

### Pool Management

- **Creating Pools**: Set up new liquidity pools with specific token pairs and parameters.
- **Modifying Pools**: Update pool parameters, including token weights and swap fees.

```bash
pryzmd tx amm modify-pool <pool_id> <new_params> --from <your_wallet>
```

### Token Management

- **Adding Tokens**: Introduce new tokens into a pool, increasing the pool's liquidity.
- **Removing Tokens**: Remove tokens from a pool or withdraw liquidity as needed.

```bash
pryzmd tx amm add-token <pool_id> <token_params> --from <your_wallet>
```

## Trading and Swapping

The AMM module handles all trading operations through liquidity pools, allowing users to swap tokens seamlessly.

### Swap Operations

Users can execute token swaps within the pool, with prices determined by the pool's algorithm.

```bash
pryzmd tx amm swap <input_token> <output_token> <amount> --from <your_wallet>
```

### Fee Structures

Each swap incurs a fee, distributed to liquidity providers in the pool. Fee rates can be customized at the pool level.

## Liquidity Management

Liquidity providers contribute tokens to pools, enabling trading and earning a share of the transaction fees.

### Providing Liquidity

Add liquidity to existing pools, enabling users to trade tokens.

```bash
pryzmd tx amm provide-liquidity <pool_id> <token_amounts> --from <your_wallet>
```

### Withdrawing Liquidity

Remove liquidity from pools, redeeming your share of the tokens.

```bash
pryzmd tx amm withdraw-liquidity <pool_id> <amount> --from <your_wallet>
```

### Rewards and Incentives

Liquidity providers earn rewards based on the fees generated by trades in the pool. These rewards are distributed proportionally to their contribution.

## Governance and Proposals

The AMM module is fully integrated with Pryzm's governance system, allowing users to propose changes to pool parameters, fee structures, or the introduction of new features.

```bash
pryzmd tx gov submit-proposal <proposal_type> --from <your_wallet>
```

## Events and Logs

The module generates events for all significant operations, including pool creation, liquidity provision, and swaps. These events can be monitored for insights into market activity.

### Event Types

- **Pool Created**: Logs the creation of a new pool.
- **Swap Executed**: Captures details of token swaps within a pool.
- **Liquidity Added/Removed**: Tracks changes in pool liquidity.

## Queries

The AMM module supports various query operations to fetch details about pools, tokens, and trades.

### Pool Queries

Retrieve details about a specific pool, including token balances, swap fees, and more.

```bash
pryzmd query amm pool <pool_id>
```

### Trade Simulations

Simulate trades to estimate outcomes before executing actual swaps.

```bash
pryzmd query amm simulate-trade <input_token> <output_token> <amount>
```

## Advanced Features

The AMM module includes several advanced features that enhance the trading experience, such as yield farming mechanisms and custom AMM configurations.

### Yield Farming Mechanisms

Pools can be configured to automatically reinvest returns, generating additional yield for liquidity providers.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the AMM module, here are some common solutions:

- **Invalid Swap**: Ensure that the input and output tokens exist in the specified pool.
- **Insufficient Liquidity**: Check the pool's liquidity levels before attempting large trades.

## API Reference

The AMM module provides several API endpoints for developers to interact with the pools programmatically.

### Sample API Calls

- **Get Pool Info**: `GET /api/amm/pool/<pool_id>`
- **Perform Swap**: `POST /api/amm/swap`

## Security Considerations

The AMM module is designed with security in mind. It undergoes regular audits, and all transactions are executed through smart contracts. Ensure that your pools and tokens are configured correctly to avoid vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The AMM module is a powerful tool within the Pryzm ecosystem, enabling decentralized trading, liquidity provision, and yield generation. For more details and advanced configurations, refer to the official [AMM Module Documentation](https://docs.pryzm.zone/core/amm).
