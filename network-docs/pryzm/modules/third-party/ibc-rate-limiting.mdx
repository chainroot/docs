# IBC Rate-Limiting Module

The IBC Rate-Limiting module is a middleware solution integrated into the Pryzm network that provides an additional layer of security for cross-chain token transfers. It prevents massive inflows or outflows of IBC tokens within a short timeframe, offering protection against economic instability, attacks, or potential bugs.

## Overview

IBC Rate-Limiting helps maintain the security and stability of cross-chain transactions by controlling the flow of tokens. This module is particularly useful in preventing scenarios where large amounts of tokens are moved in a way that could destabilize the receiving or sending blockchain, whether due to malicious intent or unintended errors.

## Key Features

- **Flow Control**: Limits the rate of IBC token transfers to prevent large, destabilizing inflows or outflows.
- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against economic attacks or bugs that could lead to massive token movements across chains.
- **Stability**: Helps ensure the stability of the Pryzm network and other interconnected blockchains by controlling token flows.

## Functions

### Rate-Limiting Token Transfers

The IBC Rate-Limiting module ensures that token transfers via IBC do not exceed predefined thresholds, safeguarding the network from potential economic instability.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc rate-limit set-limits --token TOKEN_DENOM --max-inflow MAX_AMOUNT --max-outflow MAX_AMOUNT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

### Managing Rate Limits

Network operators can adjust the rate limits for specific tokens to suit the needs of their blockchain, ensuring the network remains secure while accommodating expected transaction volumes.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc rate-limit update-limits --token TOKEN_DENOM --new-max-inflow MAX_AMOUNT --new-max-outflow MAX_AMOUNT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

## Queries

You can query the IBC Rate-Limiting module using the following commands:

- **Query Current Rate Limits**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc rate-limit limits
  ```

- **Query Recent Transfers**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc rate-limit recent-transfers
  ```
