# Packet-Forward Middleware Module

The Packet-Forward Middleware module is an IBC middleware integrated into the Pryzm network. It enables the routing of incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination chain. This middleware allows for seamless cross-chain communication and transfer of assets between interconnected blockchains.

## Overview

Packet-Forward Middleware is designed to facilitate the transfer of assets and messages between different blockchains connected via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. By enabling packet forwarding, this middleware enhances the interoperability between chains, making it easier to route transactions across the ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Routing**: Facilitates the routing of IBC packets from one chain to another, enabling seamless cross-chain communication.
- **Asset Transfers**: Supports the transfer of assets between interconnected blockchains within the Pryzm ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Interoperability**: Promotes interoperability between blockchains, allowing for more complex cross-chain interactions.

## Functions

### Forwarding IBC Packets

The Packet-Forward Middleware module enables the forwarding of IBC packets from the source chain to the destination chain, ensuring that messages and transactions reach their intended targets.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc packet-forward FORWARD_COMMAND --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

### Asset Transfers

The module supports the transfer of assets across chains by routing the necessary IBC packets between source and destination chains.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc transfer asset SOURCE_CHAIN DESTINATION_CHAIN --amount AMOUNT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

## Queries

You can query the Packet-Forward Middleware module using the following commands:

- **Query Packet Routes**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc packet-forward routes
  ```

- **Query Forwarded Packets**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc packet-forward forwarded-packets
  ```
