# Wasmd Module

The Wasmd module is a key integration in the Pryzm network, enabling the deployment and execution of smart contracts based on WebAssembly (WASM). This module allows developers to create and run complex decentralized applications (dApps) on the Pryzm blockchain.

## Overview

Wasmd is a third-party module that provides support for WASM smart contracts within the Pryzm ecosystem. It facilitates the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts, empowering developers to build innovative solutions that interact directly with the blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract Support**: Enables the execution of WASM-based smart contracts on the Pryzm network.
- **Flexible Contract Deployment**: Allows developers to deploy new smart contracts or interact with existing contracts.
- **Decentralized Applications**: Supports the development of dApps that can automate processes and interact with on-chain data.

## Functions

### Smart Contract Deployment

The Wasmd module allows users to deploy smart contracts written in WebAssembly, providing a flexible framework for creating decentralized applications.

```bash
pryzmd tx wasm store CONTRACT_CODE --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

### Smart Contract Execution

Once deployed, smart contracts can be executed to perform various operations, such as transferring tokens, updating contract state, or interacting with other on-chain entities.

```bash
pryzmd tx wasm execute CONTRACT_ADDRESS '{ "execute": { "data": "example" } }' --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

## Queries

You can query the Wasmd module using the following commands:

- **Query Contract State**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query wasm contract-state CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  ```

- **Query Contract Info**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query wasm contract-info CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  ```
