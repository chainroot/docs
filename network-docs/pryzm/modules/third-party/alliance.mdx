# Alliance Module

The Alliance module in the Pryzm network is designed to facilitate yield trading and liquidity sharing between different blockchains. This module enables cross-chain collaborations, allowing blockchains to pool and trade yield, thereby creating a more interconnected and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

## Overview

The Alliance module makes it possible for different blockchains to enter into agreements to share and trade yield. This feature enhances liquidity across the ecosystem, promoting a more robust and scalable DeFi landscape within the Pryzm network.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Yield Trading**: Facilitates the trading and sharing of yield between blockchains.
- **Liquidity Sharing**: Allows blockchains to pool liquidity and distribute yield across chains.
- **Interoperability**: Promotes cross-chain collaborations, enhancing the overall interconnectedness of the DeFi ecosystem.

## Functions

### Yield Trading

The Alliance module allows blockchains to enter agreements to trade and share yield, enabling liquidity providers to maximize returns across multiple chains.

```bash
pryzmd tx alliance trade-yield PARTNER_CHAIN --amount AMOUNT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

### Liquidity Sharing

Blockchains can pool liquidity across different chains, ensuring that yield is distributed efficiently and that liquidity is maintained where it's needed most.

```bash
pryzmd tx alliance share-liquidity PARTNER_CHAIN --amount AMOUNT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```
