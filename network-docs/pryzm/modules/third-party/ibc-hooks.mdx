# IBC-Hooks Module

The IBC-Hooks module enhances the functionality of the IBC protocol within the Pryzm network by enabling ICS-20 token transfers to trigger smart contract calls. This feature introduces programmable logic to cross-chain token transfers, allowing developers to create more dynamic and automated workflows.

## Overview

IBC-Hooks is a middleware module that extends the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It allows ICS-20 token transfers to be combined with smart contract execution, enabling the automation of processes such as staking, yield farming, or governance participation whenever a token transfer occurs.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract Execution on Token Transfers**: Enables ICS-20 token transfers to trigger smart contract calls, allowing programmable logic to be integrated with IBC transactions.
- **Automated Workflows**: Facilitates the automation of processes across chains, such as staking or yield farming, by combining token transfers with contract execution.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Enhances cross-chain interactions by enabling programmable functionality in IBC transfers.

## Functions

### Triggering Contract Calls

The IBC-Hooks module allows ICS-20 token transfers to initiate contract calls, enabling complex interactions between blockchains during token transfers.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc-hooks transfer TOKEN_DENOM DESTINATION_CHAIN --amount AMOUNT --contract-call '{"action": "trigger"}' --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

### Automated Contract Execution

Developers can automate the execution of smart contracts when tokens are transferred via IBC, streamlining workflows such as staking or reward distribution.

```bash
pryzmd tx ibc-hooks execute TOKEN_TRANSFER_CONTRACT --from YOUR_KEY --chain-id pryzm-chain
```

## Queries

You can query the IBC-Hooks module using the following commands:

- **Query Hooked Contracts**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc-hooks contracts
  ```

- **Query Active Transfers with Hooks**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query ibc-hooks active-transfers
  ```
