# Epochs Module

The Epochs module in the Osmosis network is responsible for managing fixed periods of time, known as epochs, during which certain network functions and operations are executed. This module helps structure the execution of repetitive tasks, such as reward distribution, minting, and other time-dependent events.

## Overview

An epoch is a defined period of time, and the Epochs module ensures that specific actions occur at regular intervals. This structured timing is crucial for ensuring consistency across the network, especially for operations that require synchronization, like staking rewards or liquidity incentives.

## Key Features

- **Fixed Time Intervals**: Defines and manages epochs, ensuring that operations are executed at regular intervals.
- **Time-Triggered Operations**: Allows modules to schedule functions to run at the end of each epoch.
- **Epoch-Based Events**: Ensures that events such as rewards distribution and minting happen consistently across the network.

## Functions

### Epoch Creation

The Epochs module allows the creation of epochs with specified durations. These epochs are then used to trigger events across the network.

```go
type Epoch struct {
    Identifier string
    Duration   time.Duration
    CurrentEpoch int64
    StartTime   time.Time
}
```

### Scheduling Operations

Modules can register operations to be executed at the end of each epoch. These operations include tasks such as distributing staking rewards or minting new tokens.

```bash
pryzmd tx epochs schedule-operation OPERATION_NAME --epoch EPOCH_ID --from YOUR_KEY
```

## Queries

You can query the Epochs module using the following commands:

- **Query Current Epoch**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query epochs current --identifier EPOCH_ID
  ```

- **Query Epoch Parameters**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query epochs params
  ```
