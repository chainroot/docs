# Mint Module

The Mint module is responsible for the creation of new tokens on the Pryzm network. These tokens are used for various purposes, such as rewarding validators, incentivizing liquidity provision in pools, and supporting community efforts.

## Overview

The Mint module handles the periodic creation of tokens based on predefined parameters. It uses time-based epochs, supported by the `epochs` module, and includes a flexible inflation rate mechanism that responds to market demand.

## Key Concepts

- **Inflation Rate**: The inflation rate adjusts based on the ratio of bonded tokens. If the bonded ratio is below the target (e.g., 67%), the inflation rate increases. Conversely, it decreases if the bonded ratio exceeds the target.
- **Epoch-Based Minting**: New tokens are minted at the end of each epoch (default: one week).
- **Distribution Proportions**: Minted tokens are distributed to various accounts, including staking rewards, pool incentives, and the community pool.

## Functions

### Inflation Calculation

The inflation rate is recalculated at the end of each epoch. The rate can increase or decrease based on the bonded token ratio compared to the target ratio (67%).

```go
func (m Minter) NextInflationRate(params Params, bondedRatio sdk.Dec, epochsPerYear int64) sdk.Dec {
  // (1 - bondedRatio/GoalBonded) * InflationRateChange
  inflationRateChangePerYear := sdk.OneDec().
    Sub(bondedRatio.Quo(params.GoalBonded)).
    Mul(params.InflationRateChange)

  inflationRateChange := inflationRateChangePerYear.Quo(sdk.NewDec(epochsPerYear))

  // adjust the new annual inflation for this next cycle
  inflation := m.Inflation.Add(inflationRateChange) // note inflationRateChange may be negative
  if inflation.GT(params.InflationMax) {
    inflation = params.InflationMax
  }
  if inflation.LT(params.InflationMin) {
    inflation = params.InflationMin
  }

  return inflation
}
```

### Distribution

Minted tokens are distributed at the end of each epoch. The distribution proportions are determined by the module's parameters and are allocated to various accounts.

```go
func (k Keeper) distributeMintedCoin(ctx sdk.Context, mintedCoin sdk.Coin) (_ *types.DistributionProportions, err error)
```

## Queries

You can query the Mint module using the following commands:

- **Query Parameters**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query mint params
  ```

- **Query Minter State**:

  ```bash
  pryzmd query mint minter
  ```
