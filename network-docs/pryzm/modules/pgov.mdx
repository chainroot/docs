# pGov Module

The **pGov** module enables ICStaked asset holders to participate in the governance of the asset's native chain by voting on proposals using their cAssets and pAssets. Proposals from supported asset chains are mirrored on PRYZM, allowing for governance participation through PRYZM's pGov module.

## Core Concepts

### Staking pASSETs

Holders of cAssets can refract their assets into pAssets and stake them to participate in native chain voting. The staked pAssets contribute to the voting power and can be redeemed anytime. The amount of staked assets at the time of vote tallying determines the voting power.

### Mirroring Proposals

Before a vote can occur, proposals from supported asset chains are mirrored on PRYZM. Users can submit these proposals to PRYZM with proof of their existence on the host chain. The mirrored proposals allow PRYZM users to vote within a shorter timeframe.

### Proposal Voting

Voting power is calculated based on the staked pAssets and cAsset balances. PRYZM utilizes weighted voting similar to the Cosmos governance module, allowing for various vote options and secure voting via Interchain Account (ICA) mechanisms.
