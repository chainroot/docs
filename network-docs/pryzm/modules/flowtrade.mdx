# FlowTrade Module

The FlowTrade module on the Pryzm network is designed to facilitate token swaps during a defined trading period. This module ensures that liquidity providers can offer and withdraw liquidity at specified times, enabling controlled and predictable trading dynamics.

## Overview

The FlowTrade module allows token swaps to occur within specific periods, giving users more control over when and how trades happen. This feature is especially useful for protocols that need time-based liquidity provision and for those looking to schedule trades in advance.

## Key Features

- **Time-Based Liquidity**: Facilitates the provision and withdrawal of liquidity during defined time periods.

- **Controlled Token Swaps**: Enables users to plan and execute token swaps in a structured manner.

}
```

### Liquidity Management
