# Network Modules of Pryzm

Pryzm's modular architecture is central to its functionality, allowing for a highly adaptable and robust decentralized finance ecosystem. This document provides an in-depth look at the core and third-party modules that define the Pryzm network.

## Core Modules Developed by Pryzm

### ICStaking Module
- **Functionality**: Provides interchain liquid staking for cosmos-based chainsâ€™ native tokens and minting cASSET as the LSD.

### Assets Module
- **Functionality**: Manages assets eligible for refraction and trading on Pryzm.

### Refractor Module
- **Functionality**: Enables the refraction of supported assets into pASSET and yASSET, allowing for the merging and redemption of these assets.

### YStaking Module
- **Functionality**: Facilitates the staking of yASSETs to earn rewards through staked assets.

### AMM Module
- **Functionality**: Supports various automated market maker models, enabling the creation, management, and interaction with liquidity pools.

### Incentives Module
- **Functionality**: Provides incentives for token holders participating in the system.

### PGov Module
- **Functionality**: Allows cASSET and pASSET holders to participate in governance of their asset's native chain by mirroring proposals on PRYZM.

### Treasury Module
- **Functionality**: Manages the collection and scheduling of actions on collected fees.

### Mint Module
- **Functionality**: Controls the minting and distribution of PRYZM tokens.

### Oracle Module
- **Functionality**: Provides generic oracle functions where modules can integrate oracle services by providing a vote callback.

### FlowTrade Module
- **Functionality**: Facilitates token swaps within a defined period.

## Modules Copied from Osmosis

### Epochs Module
- **Functionality**: Provides on-chain timers for other modules to execute code during specific times.

### TokenFactory Module
- **Functionality**: Allows the minting of new tokens in user-defined subdenominations.

## Third-Party Modules Integrated into PRYZM

### WASMD Module
- **Functionality**: Enables smart contracts on the chain.

### Block SDK Module
- **Functionality**: Allows full customization of blocks using application logic; also processes MEV bundled transactions.

### Alliance Module
- **Functionality**: Facilitates yield trading between blockchains.

### Packet Forward Middleware
- **Functionality**: An IBC middleware enabling the chain to route incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination chain.

### IBC Hooks Module
- **Functionality**: An IBC middleware that enables ICS-20 token transfers to initiate contract calls.

### IBC Rate Limiting Module
- **Functionality**: Prevents massive inflows or outflows of IBC tokens in a short time frame as a safety control.

## Integration and Interaction
- **Description**: These modules interact seamlessly to provide a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem, enhancing both the functionality and security of the Pryzm network.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Integrating diverse modules while maintaining high performance and security.
- **Solution**: Rigorous testing, community feedback, and continuous development to refine and enhance module functionalities.

## Conclusion
Pryzm's modular architecture provides the foundation for a dynamic and scalable DeFi ecosystem, making it a key player in the advancement of decentralized finance.
