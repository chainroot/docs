# Epochs Module in Osmosis

The Epochs module in Osmosis plays a vital role in managing fixed time periods for various network functions.

## Key Functionalities
- **Time-Based Management**: Facilitates the execution of network functions based on predefined time periods, known as epochs.
- **Scheduled Operations**: Enables the scheduling of tasks like rewards distribution and governance actions in line with epoch cycles.

## Usage and Examples
- **Configuring Epochs**: Steps to set up and manage epoch durations and schedules.
- **Epoch-Based Network Activities**: Understanding how network activities are aligned with epoch cycles.

For more information on the Epochs module, visit [Osmosis Documentation](https://docs.osmosis.zone/).
