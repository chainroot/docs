# Establishing a Validator on Osmosis

Becoming a validator on the Osmosis network is a multi-step process that involves node operation, wallet management, and validator initiation.

## Steps to Run a Validator

### 1. Node Operation
- **Mainnet vs. Testnet**: Choose between running a node on the mainnet or testnet. Mainnet operation requires advanced network security knowledge. Refer to [Running a Node](./running-a-node.mdx) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Wallet Keyring Setup
- **Creating a Wallet**: Use `osmosisd keys add [KEY_NAME]` to create a new wallet. Securely store the mnemonic phrase generated during this process.

### 3. Acquiring Validator Public Key
- **Public Key Retrieval**: Obtain your validator's public key with `osmosisd tendermint show-validator`.

### 4. Validator Initialization
- **Staking OSMO**: Ensure your wallet has a sufficient OSMO balance. Initialize your validator using:
  ```bash
  osmosisd tx staking create-validator \
  --from=[KEY_NAME] \
  --amount=[staking_amount_uosmo] \
  --pubkey=$(osmosisd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="[moniker_id_of_your_node]" \
  --security-contact="[security contact email/contact method]" \
  --chain-id="[chain-id]" \
  --commission-rate="[commission_rate]" \
  --commission-max-rate="[maximum_commission_rate]" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="[maximum_rate_of_change_of_commission]" \
  --min-self-delegation="[min_self_delegation_amount]"
  ```
  Replace placeholders with your specific details.

### 5. Validator Management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and manage your validator to maintain security and efficiency.

## Important Considerations
Running a validator demands a solid grasp of blockchain technology and network security. Stay updated with the latest practices by consulting the [Osmosis Validator Guide](https://osmosis-labs.github.io/osmosis/validators/) and [Osmosis Documentation](https://docs.osmosis.zone/overview/validate/).

These resources offer in-depth guidance on each step of the process and provide additional tips for effective validator management.
